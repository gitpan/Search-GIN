Search::GIN::Query::Class - Create class-based GIN queries

=head1 VERSION

    use Search::GIN::Query::Class;

    my $query = Search::GIN::Query::Class->new(
        class => 'Person',
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Creates a class-based GIN query that can be used to search records in a storage.

This is a ready-to-use query that uses class definitions (specifically C<class>,

    my $query = Search::GIN::Query::Class->new(
        does => 'TheMonkey',
    );

=head2 blessed
