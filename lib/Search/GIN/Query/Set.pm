=head1 NAME

Search::GIN::Query::Set - Create queries with set operations

=head1 VERSION

version 0.09

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # build a query like:
    # (type:pdf OR type:png) AND (name:Homer OR name:Bart)

    use Search::GIN::Query::Set;
    use Search::GIN::Query::Manual;

    my $query = Search::GIN::Query::Set->new(
        operation => 'INTERSECT',
        subqueries => [
            Search::GIN::Query::Manual->new(
                values => {
                   type => [qw(pdf png)]
                }
            ),
            Search::GIN::Query::Manual->new(
                values => {
                   name => [qw(Homer Bart)]
                }
            ),
        ]
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Creates a manual GIN query that can be used to search using basic set
theory, in order to build more complex queries.

This query doesn't provide any specific search, it's just a set
operator for subqueries. You can build complex queries by using other
set queries as subqueries for a set query.

=head1 METHODS/SUBROUTINES

=head2 new

Creates a new query.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 subqueries

The subqueries to process

=head2 operation

One of the basic set operators: "UNION", "INTERSECT" and "EXCEPT". The
default is "UNION"
